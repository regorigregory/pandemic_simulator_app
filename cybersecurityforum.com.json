            "Alternative FAQ Phrasings: What is a cybersecurity? | What is cyber security?\n\nDefinition: cybersecurity (a.k.a. cyber security, computer network security) refers to the specialization of computer network security that consists of technologies, policies, and procedures that protect networked computer systems from unauthorized use or harm. Broadly speaking, cybersecurity topics can be subdivided into two complementary areas: cyber attacks, which are essentially offensive and emphasize network penetration techniques; and cyber defenses, which are essentially protective and emphasize counter-measures intended to eliminate or mitigate cyber attacks.\n\nCyber attacks can take aim at the enterprise, government, military, and other infrastructural assets of a nation or its citizens, where these assets can include physical infrastructure (e.g., power grids, nuclear reactors) as well as computational infrastructure (e.g., computers, networks). Cyber attacks can be classified by their participating actors (states vs. non-states) and their attack mechanisms (e.g., direct attack, malware, exploits). See the Cyber Attack Classifications, Cyber Attack Malware Taxonomy, and Cyber Attack Mechanism Taxonomy sub-sections in the Cyber Attacks section for more information.\nCorrespondingly, cyber defenses must protect the enterprise, government, military, and other infrastructural assets of a nation or its citizens. As is the case with cyber attacks, cyber defenses can be classified by their participating actors (states vs. non-states) and their attack mechanisms (e.g., direct attack, malware, exploits). See the Cyber Defense Classifications and Cyber Defense Countermeasure Taxonomy sub-sections in the Cyber Defenses section for more information.\nHow to Learn More About Cybersecurity\nTo learn more about how to specify cybersecurity and related technologies, please see the following Cybersecurity FAQs:\n\nCyberSecurity FAQ - Why do we need Cybersecurity?\nCyberSecurity FAQ - What is cyber hygiene?\nCyberSecurity FAQ - What is a cybersecurity architecture?\n\nIf you have constructive recommendations to correct, clarify, or otherwise improve this or any other Cybersecurity FAQ, please contact us.\n\nCYBERSECURITY & DESIGN HANDS-ON WORKSHOP TRAINING OPTIONS\nIf you seek professional cybersecurity architecture hands-on training that emphasizes robust architecture modeling languages (UML2, SysML, CyberML), strong cyptographic techniques, popular architecture modeling tools (Sparx EA, MagicDraw/Cameo, Rhapsody), and numerous practice exercises, check out PivotPoint's Essential Cybersecurity Architecture & Design Applied hands-on training workshops."

            "The increasing reliance of our information-age economies and governments on cyber (computer-based) infrastructure makes them progressively more vulnerable to cyber attacks on our computer systems, networks, and data. In their most disruptive form, cyber attacks target the enterprise, government, military, or other infrastructural assets of a nation or its citizens. Both the volume and sophistication of cyber threats (cyber warfare, cyber terrorism, cyber espionage and malicious hacking) are monotonically increasing, and pose potent threats to our enterprise, government, military, or other infrastructural assets. Knowing that to be forewarned is to be forearmed, we are well advised to effect strong Cybersecurity defenses that will thwart rapidly evolving cyber threats.\nRecent newsworthy cyber attacks on critical cyber infrastructure (e.g., Target data breach, Mt. Gox bitcoin hacker attacks, NSA data leaks and subsequent PRISM revelations) demonstrate the urgent need for improved cybersecurity. As cyber threats grow, so must our abilities to neutralize them. Towards that end, the U.S. government issued an Executive Order for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity in February 2013, and the 2014 President's Budget devoted over $13B to cyber-related programs and activities [Federal Information Technology FY 2014 Budget Priorities, p. 15]. The European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) lists all known public documents of National Cyber Security Strategies in the EU, as well as the rest of the world."

            "Alternative FAQ Phrasings: What is a cyber hygiene? | What is cybersecurity hygiene? | What is cyber security hygiene?\n\nDefinition: cyber hygiene (a.k.a., cybersecurity hygiene, cyber security hygiene) is a colloquial term that refers to best practices and other activities that computer system administrators and users can undertake to improve their cybersecurity while engaging in common online activities, such as web browsing, emailing, texting, etc.\n\nEtymology\nThe term cyber hygiene was coined by Vinton Cerf, an Internet pioneer, who used the expression in his statement to the United States Congress Joint Economic Committee on 23 February 2000, where boldface is added for emphasis:\n\nIt is my judgment that the Internet itself is for the most part secure, though there are steps we know can be take to improve security and resilience. Most of the vulnerabilities arise from those who use the Internet--companies, governments, academic institutions, and individuals alike--but who do not practice what I refer to as good cyber hygiene. They are not sufficiently sensitive to the need to protect the security of the Internet community of which they are a part. The openness of the Internet is both its blessing and its curse when it comes to security.\n\nCyber Hygiene Best Practices\nCyber hygiene related best practices for computer network/system administrators include, but are not limited to:\n\nensuring that routers and firewalls are installed and properly configured;\nupdating both \u201cwhite lists\" (authorized users) and \"black lists\" (unauthorized users), and enforcing compartmentalized (\"need to know\") user permissions for authorized users;\nensuring that all anti-virus (AV), spamware, and other anti-malware protection software is properly installed and configured;\nupdating all Operating System (OS), application software, web browsers and firmware with latest security patches;\nenforcing strong password rules and 2-Factor/Multi-Factor Authorization (2FA/MFA) procedures;\nensuring that all computer networks are physically segmented with secure routers and active firewalls between segments;\n\nCyber hygiene related best practices for computer system users include, but are not limited to, using strong passwords and 2FA/MFA, avoiding accessing cybersecure systems on unauthorized and/or non-secure BYODs (Bring Your Own Devices), and avoiding mixing personal with cybersecure email and/or work documents.\nFor more information about Recommended Best Practices for Cyber Hygiene - Top 10, see the CyberSecurity FAQ - What are the best practices for cyber hygiene?.\nIf you have constructive recommendations to correct, clarify, or otherwise improve this or any other Cybersecurity FAQ, please contact us.\n\nCYBER HYGIENE HANDS-ON TRAINING OPTIONS\nIf you seek professional cyber hygiene training that demystifies the technobabble of cybersecurity and emphasizes pragmatic best practices for protecting your sensitive \"crown jewel\" data, check out PivotPoint's Essential Cyber Hygiene Applied hands-on training workshops."

            "RECOMMENDED BEST PRACTICES FOR CYBER HYGIENE - TOP 10\nThe best practices for effective cyber hygiene should include and extend the following:\n\nProtect your computer network with secure routers with robust firewalls. While traveling, use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) and/or software firewall.\nThe 1st line of cyber defense in computer network security is to install and maintain a secure Internet Protocol (IP) router and a robust firewall that prevents unauthorized users from accessing data, email, applications, web browsers, etc. If you are a computer system administrator: install and configure a secure commerical IP router, white list all approved users, black list all unknown users, and ensure that the wireless (WiFi) communications use WPA2/WPA3 encryption for wireless comunications. If you are a home computer user, check out the Home Broadband Routers section of the LifeWire What Is a Router for Computer Networks? article. If you are traveling away from your business or home computer network, ensure that you are using a secure Virtual Private Network (VPN) and/or your Operating System (OS) has a secure software firewall turned on.\nInstall dependable anti-virus (AV) and anti-malware software that continuously scans your computer/mobile phone, and update it frequently\nThe 2nd line of cyber defense in computer network security is to install and maintain robust anti-virus (AV) and anti-malware software that scans and terminates computer viruses and other kinds of malicious sofware (malware). If you are a computer system administrator install a robust commericial Intrusion Protection Device/Intrusion Protection Device product; if you are a home computer user ensure that you install either a commercial or FOSS (Free & Open Source Software) AV software product.\nUpdate all OS, Web Browser and Application software with security patches in a timely manner.\nThe 3rd line of cyber defense in computer network security is to update all Operating System (OS), web browser, and application software regularly to ensure that security patches are properly installed in a timely manner. These security patches are essential to make sure that all currently-known cybersecurity vulnerabilities have been closed.\nDefine strong passwords and use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) whenever available\n\nDefine strong passwords that are unique and complex: 12+ characters, combo of lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, and special chars (e.g., !@#$%^&*).\nDo not share passwords, change them regularly (say every 3 months), and do not share the same passwords.\nUse 2-Factor Authentication (2FA) or Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), which adds an additional layer of security to passwords, whereever practical, especially to financial, health, and other confidential accounts. 2FA and MFA greatly increases security by corroborating your password with additional information such as a unique pin, biometrics (facial or fingerprint recognition), secondary device (e.g., a personal mobile phone can corroborate web browser password login on a desktop computer).\n\nPractice safe web browsing habits\nSince many commercial companies seek to harvest personal data it is essential that you practice safe web browing habits which include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n\nConfigure your web browsers' privacy and security settings to block third party cookies, not save passwords, not autocomplete, and not save search histories. (If there is no configuration to not save search histories, purge these and all other saved information, regularly.\nSet your default web browser search engine to a choice that does not track your query content and habits, for example, DuckDuckGo.\nSet your default web browse to a choice that fully complies with current W3C standards and supports security plugins. For example, Free & Open Source Software (FOSS) FireFox fully complies with W3C web standards and supports the following security plugins:\n\n\nHTTPS Everywhere The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and The Tor Project jointly developed this Firefox, Chrome, and Opera extension to support the secure HTTPS communications protocol vs. the standard HTTP protocol, which is more widely used but less secure. (The \u2018S\u2019 in HTTPS stands for \u2018secure.\u2019) HTTPS Everywhere encrypts communications with many major websites to help secure your browsing experience.\nWeb of Trust (a.k.a. WOT). This extension for FireFox, Internet Explorer, Chrome, Safari, and Opera helps determine if a website is safe to surf. The extension displays traffic signal icons next to URLs and links. Green means the site is reliable; yellow indicates you should proceed with caution; red translates to \u201csteer clear.\u201d The ratings are crowdsourced from WOT\u2019s global user base and are supported by trusted third-party sources, such as up-to-date directories of malware sites.\n\nCheck out shortened links from a non-trusted source prior to clicking on them, since they have been known to mask malicious links. Check out via ExpandURL or CheckShort URL online utilities.\nOnly visit web sites with via HTTPS (= HTTP Secure) protocol and ensure that the web site's SSL Certificate is valid. (Typically the web URL will begin with \"https://\u2026\" and the web browser will show a \"padlock\" icon if the site's SSL certificate is valid.\nBeware when installing web browser plugins from unknown/untrusted sources. All plugins should be simple and single-purpose in nature; complex, multi-function plugins that are not properly maintained can increase cyber attack surfaces to exploit.\nFor more detailed information about safe web browsing habits check out the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) Securing Your Web Browser guide, which explains web browser features and associated risks (e.g., ActiveX, Java, JavaScript, cookies, certain plug-ins, cookies, etc.).\n\nPractice safe email habits\nConsider that most free commerical email services (GMail, Outlook.com, iCloud Mail, Yahoo Mail, GMX Mail etc.) compromise your privacy to serve targeted ads or otherwise exploit your personal data, it is essential that you practice safe email habits, which include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n\nBeware of spear fishing emails from unknown/untrusted sources that may link to or contain mailware! Do not click on a link or open an attachment from an unknown/untrusted source. Delete and purge subject email and blacklist the sender.\nDo not include sensitive or confidential information (e.g., financial, health) in your email subject, content or plaintext (unencrypted text, a.k.a. clear text) attachment. If you need to send sensitive or secure information via email, encrypt it as an attachment, and send the password via an alternative mechanism (e.g., voice communication, SMS/MMS text message, separate unassociated email).\nConsider a secure email service, with end-to-end encryption to ensure that your email content remains private. Check out: The 5 Best Secure Email Services for 2019: Encrypted email services keep your messages private.\n\nKeep your user data separate from applications, and apply strong encryption to all sensitive and confidential data\nKeep all user data separate from user applications, and keep personal data separate from business data. Apply strong encryption (AES-256 bit or higher) with strong passwords (see #4 above) to all sensive and confidential data including, but not limited to, financial and health data.\nKeep your user data separate from applications, and back up data regularly\nKeep all user data separate from user applications (see #6 above) and back up data to another network node (computer or server) frequently (weekly if not daily), and offsite (cloud-based and/or bank deposit box) regularly (monthly if not bi-weekly).\nBe wary and selective when buying goods or services online.\nYou should be specially wary when buying goods or services online, especially when it is a unknown/untrusted source. In general you should:\n\n\nCheck the website is secure. Check that the website URL starts with the letters \u201cHTTPS://\u201d and has an image of a small \"padlock\", usually in the top left-hand corner (see #5 above)\nSelect your item(s) you wish to purchase, add them to your Shopping Cart temporary storage, and proceed to the Check Out page to pay.\nEnter your credit card details (name, address, phone number, email, credit card#, CVV#, etc.) as needed.\nVerify that shipping and billing information are correct.\nConfirm payment and keep a soft copy of the payment information.\n\nWhen selling and disposing of computers and storage devices securely erase all persistent storage.\nWhen selling or disposing of your desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone or USB drive, it\u2019s critical that you securely wipe (erase) all personal, sensitive and confidential data. Deleting files alone is insufficient, since they frequently can be recovered by hackers and forensic specialists. Conequently, you should securely erase as explained in the following PC World article How to securely erase your hard drive. Check out Scientific American's How to Destroy a Hard Drive\u2014Permanently article.\n\nKeep in mind that, like human hygiene, you need to practice cyber hygiene on a regular, systematic basis for it to be effective. Don't worry above implementing all ten of the best practices listed above immediately; you will be better served by implementing them incrementally and opportunistically as you become more cyber WOK (aware)!\nIf you have constructive recommendations to correct, clarify or otherwise improve this or any other Cybersecurity FAQ please contact us.\n\nCYBER HYGIENE HANDS-ON TRAINING OPTIONS\nIf you seek professional cyber hygiene training that demystifies the technobabble of cybersecurity and emphasizes pragmatic best practices for protecting your sensitive \"crown jewel\" data, check out PivotPoint's Essential Cyber Hygiene Applied hands-on training workshops."

Compare with symmetric warfare, where the belligerents possess comparable military powers and apply similar strategies and tactics.Cyber warfare is considered to be a kind of asymmetric warfare because it potentially allows for significantly weaker actors (including nation states, terrorist organizations, criminal organizations, and \u201clone wolf\u201d individuals) to wreak substantial financial and infrastructure damage on vastly more powerful nation states."

            "Background: In general usage, a firewall is a fire-resistant barrier that is used to prevent the spread of fire for a prescribed period of time. Fire walls are built between or within buildings, or within an aircraft or vehicle.In the context of computer networks, a firewall is a network security system that monitors incoming and outgoing network message traffic and prevents the transmission of malicious messages based on an updatable rule set. In effect, a firewall establishes a barrier between a trusted, secure internal network and external networks (e.g., the Internet) that are assumed to be untrustworthy and non-secure. Firewalls can be implemented as software that runs on general-purpose hardware (e.g., an open source firewall on a Windows PC or Mac OS X computer) or a dedicated hardware device (appliance).How does a firewall work? In essence, firewalls function as a filter between a trusted, secure internal network and external networks (e.g., the Internet) that are assumed to be untrustworthy and non-secure. The firewall filter may be flexibly programmed to control what information packets are allowed and blocked."

        "responses": [
            "Anti-virus software, a.k.a anti-malware software, is computer software used to scan files to identify and eliminate malicious software (malware). Although anti-virus software was originally developed to detect and remove computer viruses (hence its name), it has been broadened in scope to detect other malware, such as worms, Trojan horses, adware, spyware, ransomware, etc.How does anti-virus software work? Anti-virus software typically uses two different techniques to identify and eliminate malware:Virus dictionary approach: The anti-virus software scans a file while referring to a dictionary of known virus signatures that have been previously identified. If a code segment in the file matches any virus signature in the virus dictionary, then the anti-virus software performs one or more of the following operations: deletes the file; quarantines the file so that it is unable to spread; or attempts to repair the file by removing the virus from the file.Suspicious behavior approach: The anti-virus software monitors the behavior of all programs, flagging suspicious behavior, such as one executing program attempting to write date to another executable program. The user is alerted to all suspicious behavior, and is queried regarding how the suspicious behavior should be handled.An advantage of the suspicious behavior approach over the virus dictionary approach is that the former can provide protection against new viruses whose signatures have not yet been incorporated into the latter\u2019s virus dictionary. The two approaches are complementary and can be synergistically combined."

(See FAQ: What is perimeter-based cybersecurity?) When properly deployed, MTD confuses cyber adversaries and makes them expend more resources, such as time or computation power, to expose vulnerabilities.Common MTD techniques include, but are not limited to:- shifting IP addresses so that attackers can't keep track of specific targets- randomizing network configurations to disorient attackers- fragmenting, encrypting, and moving sensitive data to protect \"crown jewels\"Compare and contrast with perimeter-based cybersecurity.

            "Alternative FAQ Phrasings: What is public-key encryption? | What is public-key cryptography?Public-key encryption is an asymmetrical cryptographic system which uses a pair of mathematically related cryptographic keys:\n\npublic key: As its name implies, the public cryptographic key is widely known. Public keys are typically made available via a public directory or repository.\nprivate key: As its name implies, the private cryptographic key is confidential, and is closely held by the message recipient or information concealor.\n\nThe cryptographic key pair is mathematically related in the sense that whatever is encrypted via a public key can only be decrypted via a private key, and vice versa.\nFor example, if Chauncey wants to send a confidential message to Chelsea, and wants to ensure that only Chelsea can read it, Chauncey can encrypt the message with Chelsea\u2019s public key. Only Chelsea, or someone with access to her corresponding private key, will be capable of decrypting the encrypted message back into its original unencrypted form. Even if someone intercepts Chelsea\u2019s encrypted message druing transmission, its contents will remain confidential if the interceptor lacks access to Chelsea\u2019s private key, which is essential for decryption.\nTo explicate further, consider the following pseudocode for the complementary cryptographic algorithm functions encode and decode with parameters plaintext, ciphertext, publickey, and privatekey, where the last two parameters represent a complementary public-private cryptographic key pair:\n\nencode (plaintext: String; publickey: String): ciphertext: String\ndecode (ciphertext: String; privatekey: String): plaintext: String\n\nThe input and output parameters for encode and decode functions are described below:\n\nplaintext: the unencrypted message or other information which is an input parameter to the encode function, and is a return parameter for the decode function;\nciphertext: the encrypted message or other information which is a return parameter for the encode function, and is an input parameter for the decode function;\npublickey: the public cryptographic key used by encode as an input parameter to encrypt the plaintext input parameter;\nprivatekey: the private cryptographic key used by decode as an input parameter to decrypt the ciphertext input parameters."

            "End-to-end encryption is a term used to describe a communication system where the only the sender (the origin end) and the recipient (the destination end) of a message, and no intermediaries, can read the subject message, which is rigorously encrypted throughout its transit from the source end to the receiver end. When end-to-end encryption is properly implemented, only the sender and the recipient of the message possess the cryptographic keys needed to decrypt the message\u2014even the intermediate message service has zero knowledge of the cryptographic keys required."

            "Alternative FAQ Phrasings: What is Zero-Based Proof (ZBP)? | What is a Zero-Based Proof? | What is Zero-Based Privacy?\nZero-Based Privacy cybersecurity techniques for cybersecurity are based on Zero-Knowledge Proofs (a.k.a. ZK Proofs, or ZKP for short), which are among the most powerful tools cryptographers have ever devised. Zero-Knowledge Proofs are defined as follows:\n\nDefinition: Zero-Based Proof (ZK Proof, ZKP; a.k.a. ZBP) is a cryptographic method by which one party (the Prover, P) can prove to another party (the Verifier, V) that P knows information X, without conveying any information to V other than P knows a value X. The insight to understanding Zero-Knowledge Proofs is that while it is trivial to prove that one possesses knowledge of value by simply revealing it, it is relatively challenging to prove possession of such knowledge without revealing either a) the information itself; or b) additional information.\n\nFor an intuitive introduction to Zero-Knowledge Proofs without substantial mathematics, see Zero Knowledge Proofs: An illustrated primer.\nAs a practical application of Zero-Knowledge Proofs, Zero-Knowledge Privacy is defined as follows:\n\nDefinition: Zero-Based Privacy is the practical application of Zero-Based Proofs to improve the security of computer servers that store and transmit sensitive/confidential client data (messages, files, database entries, authentication information, cryptographic keys, file metadata). As a general principle, a Zero-Knowledge Privacy server must never be allowed to read or write client data as plaintext (i.e., unencrypted; compare ciphertext or encrypted), including authentication information, cryptographic keys, and file metadata. Consequently, for most practical purposes the confidentiality of the client data on the server cannot be compromised via internal mismanagement (including internal prying eyes) or external agents (e.g., cyber hackers).\n\nWhile many vendors of data storage claim end-to-end encryption, many fall short of zero knowledge privacy standards because they either read or write client data and authentication information as plaintext sometime during the end-to-end data transmission or storage processes, typically for client convenience. For example, consider the case of a File Synchronization & Sharing Tool user who uploads a local file on her desktop computer to her cloud-based storage server using a web-based interface. While the web-based interface may be convenient to the user, when she enters her authentication information directly into the web-based interface as plaintext, she is compromising the confidentiality of the file she is uploaded, since the cloud-based server can read the unencrypted file along with the associated metadata and authentication information prior to encryption. Consequently, if the cloud-based server is compromised by either an external or internal cyber threat, any encrypted stored data is also potentially compromised.\nCompare this with a bona fide Zero-Knowledge Privacy approach, where the user utilizes a dedicated secure app to fully encrypt the file prior to uploading it to the cloud-based server using the SSL (Secure Socket Layer) protocol during transmission, and the secure app provides neither metadata nor unencrypted password information to the cloud-based server.\nSee Review: Secure Enterprise File Sync & Sharing (EFSS) Services for a comparison of the cybersecurity features of popular file synchronization and sharing tools, some of which provide Zero-Knowledge Privacy.\nIf you have constructive recommendations to correct, clarify, or otherwise improve this or any other Cybersecurity FAQ, please contact us.\n\nCYBERSECURITY & DESIGN HANDS-ON WORKSHOP TRAINING OPTIONS\nIf you seek professional cybersecurity architecture hands-on training that emphasizes robust architecture modeling languages (UML2, SysML, CyberML), strong cyptographic techniques, popular architecture modeling tools (Sparx EA, MagicDraw/Cameo, Rhapsody), and numerous practice exercises, check out PivotPoint's Essential Cybersecurity Architecture & Design Applied hands-on training workshops."
