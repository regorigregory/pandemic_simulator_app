# Welcome to the Pandemic Simulator

Hi! This is a simple python application which is to experiment on the effects of different population behaviors (social distancing and the population's compliance with it, quarantine, travelling between communitites...etc.) on the R0 rate. Unfortunately, it goes without saying, that due to COVID-19, this application might have gained a specific angle...
Dependencies (hardly any:):

 -python 3.8 > # though, it might work with older versions as well, haven't tested it.
 - matplotlib 
 - numpy 
 - tkinter

**Caveat:** this in no way could be used to model real world scenarios since the number of parameters are incomparable to this simulator application's. Although, this requirement might be improved on in the future....

The inspiration was drawn from 3Blue1Brown's video on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxAaO2rsdIs&t=1201s).
Watch out for high subject numbers and big infection radiuses as it can increase the computations/frame to a degree where it starts lagging :)

A quick glimpse:
